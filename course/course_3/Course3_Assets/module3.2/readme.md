# Module 3.2 — Retail SQL Lab Starter

Files:
- `retail_sample.db` — SQLite database with tables: customers, products, orders, order_items
- `schema.sql` — DDL used to create tables
- `answers.sql` — Place your queries here

Suggested prompts:
1) Monthly revenue and order count
2) Top 10 customers by revenue
3) Products with negative total profit (use items join to compute revenue minus cost)
4) Compare INNER vs LEFT join when listing customers with orders

Tips:
- Use JOINs on keys, not names
- Group only the columns you select or aggregate
