Perfect. Here is Course 1 fully generated using the exact “Learn Your Way” pattern you asked for: first personalize, then transform into synchronized views with embedded assessment and portfolio outcomes. I kept your hours at 22 and aligned every element to your outline.

# Course 1: Foundations – Data, Data Everywhere (22 hours)

**Course overview:** This course onboards beginners to data analytics, its roles, lifecycle, and ethics. Each module applies the Learn Your Way two-step pipeline: personalization to grade level and interest, then synchronized representations: immersive text with embedded questions, narrated slide outlines with speaker notes, an audio teacher–student script, and a mind map. Section-level quizzes supply Glows and Grows feedback and adapt difficulty in later items.    ([Google Research][1])

**Why this structure:** Learn Your Way’s randomized controlled study shows significantly higher immediate and three-day retention versus a standard digital reader when learners study with personalized, multi-view content and embedded formative assessment. Embedded questions and section quizzes close the loop with targeted feedback labeled as Glows and Grows.

**Hours and sequencing:**

* Module 1: 6 hours
* Module 2: 6 hours
* Module 3: 6 hours
* Module 4: 4 hours
* Capstone: included inside the 22 hours as the last 2 of the total in Module 4’s window

**Tools introduced but light-touch only:** Sheets or Excel, SQL sandbox, Tableau viewer, RStudio preview, GitHub viewing. This mirrors the toolchain used in the Google Data Analytics Certificate pathway. ([Grow with Google][2])

## Course 1 capstone: Personal Learning Roadmap

**Description:** Build a 1 to 2 page roadmap that states your target analyst role, the three skills you will prioritize, the datasets you will use for practice, and the exact artifacts you will ship in later courses. Tie each skill to an assessment plan.

**Expected artifacts:**

* Roadmap PDF and a short 2-slide deck, plus a one-paragraph GitHub README.
* Links to one dataset you plan to use from Kaggle or Google Dataset Search.
* A self-quiz plan: 10 questions you will answer at the end of Phase 2.
  This capstone closes the loop on personalization and sets up multi-view learning, consistent with the Learn Your Way approach of synchronized modalities and embedded assessment.

**Grading for Course 1 only:**

* Adaptive quizzes: 20 percent
* Hands-on labs bundle: 30 percent
* Capstone roadmap: 30 percent
* Presentation of roadmap: 20 percent
  Use Glows and Grows comments on each submission to guide iteration.

## Delivery notes for platforms

* **Bind the views:** Render immersive text by section; place a “Switch view” control to jump to narrated slides, audio dialogue, or mind map of the same content. This mirrors Learn Your Way’s synchronized representations pattern.
* **Formative assessment:** Enable embedded questions inline and a section-level quiz that returns a score plus Glows and Grows, then adjust the next item’s difficulty.
* **Tool parity with Google pathway:** Ensure learners can open sample Tableau workbooks, run basic SQL queries, and preview an R Markdown, matching the stack in Google’s Data Analytics Certificate. ([Grow with Google][2])

## Sources used for design alignment

* Google Research overview of Learn Your Way: personalization first, then multiple synchronized views with immersive text, quizzes, slides with narration, audio lessons, and mind maps. ([Google Research][1])
* Learn Your Way tech report excerpts: two-step generation, synchronized modalities, embedded questions, section-level quizzes with Glows and Grows, and retention gains in RCT.
* Google Data Analytics Certificate: tools and course sequence referenced for parity. ([Grow with Google][2])

If you want me to generate Course 2 in the same format next, say “Go Course 2” and I will deliver it with the same rigor.
