# Stakeholder Interview Guide (C2-M1)

Use this 10–12 minute framework. Capture decisions, deadlines, risks, and metrics.

## 1. Decision & Deadline
- Who decides? By when? What changes if we decide A vs B?

## 2. Metrics & Cohorts
- What metric reflects success? What cohort (new users, region, SKU) and time window?

## 3. Constraints & Risks
- Tech, privacy, data quality, budget. What would make this analysis useless?

## 4. Data Sources & Provenance
- Which tables, dashboards, owners? Known quality issues?

## 5. Action & Counterfactual
- What would we do if the result is opposite? What’s the smallest analysis that could change the decision?

> Deliverable: A brief with the decision, 6–10 SMART questions, metric dictionary, and top risks.
