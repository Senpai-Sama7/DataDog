Locked and loaded. Here is Course 2 in the exact “Learn Your Way” pattern: personalize first, then generate synchronized views with embedded checks. I align naming and scope with Google’s certificate track, and I keep the modalities, quizzes, and “Glows and Grows” feedback that Learn Your Way highlights as key to the retention gain.

# Course 2: Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions (18 hours)

**Course overview:** This course upgrades learners from vague goals to testable, decision-ready questions and clear stakeholder communication. Each module follows Learn Your Way’s two-stage pipeline: we first adapt the text to the learner’s level and interests, then we emit synchronized representations, including immersive text with embedded questions, narrated slide outlines, audio teacher-student scripts, and mind maps, plus short adaptive quizzes. This aligns with Learn Your Way’s multimodal, personalized experience that showed higher immediate and 3 to 5 day retention. ([Google Research][1])
**Google parity:** Course title and emphasis match the Google Data Analytics Certificate sequence and descriptions that stress stakeholder communication and structured thinking. ([Grow with Google][2])

**Hours and sequencing:**

* Module 1: 8 hours
* Module 2: 8 hours
* Capstone: 2 hours integrated at the end of Module 2 to reach 18 total

**Tools used lightly:** Sheets or Slides for storyboards, SQL sandbox for simple cohort pulls to support a narrative, Tableau screenshots for before or after visuals. This mirrors the toolchain highlighted across the Google certificate. ([Grow with Google][2])

## Course 2 capstone: Stakeholder presentation simulation

**Description:** Deliver a 4 to 6 minute simulation to a mock decision maker. Open with the decision, present one metric vs baseline, show a minimal analysis, and land a recommendation with a clear next step and risk note.
**Artifacts:** a 6 to 8 slide deck with speaker notes, one exported visualization, and a 150 word executive summary.
**Assessment:** panel rubric on clarity, evidence, and actionability, with “Glows and Grows” feedback that informs the first assignment in Course 3. This mirrors Learn Your Way’s practice of synchronized content plus quizzes and targeted feedback. ([Google Research][1])

**Course 2 grading split:**

* Adaptive quizzes 20 percent
* Hands-on labs bundle 30 percent
* Capstone presentation 30 percent
* Communication quality check 20 percent

---

## Delivery notes for platforms

* **Bind synchronized views:** Provide a toggle that switches between immersive text, narrated slides, audio dialogue, and mind map for the same module, consistent with Learn Your Way’s interactive experience. ([Google Research][1])
* **Adaptive checks:** Use embedded questions during reading, then a short section quiz that returns Glows and Grows feedback and adapts subsequent difficulty. ([Google Research][1])
* **Tool hooks:** Link out to Sheets, Tableau, and SQL sandbox where learners construct the smallest analysis that supports their story, matching the tools called out in the Google certificate. ([Grow with Google][2])
